will find their old favourite as full of instruction and of excitement
as ever.”--_The Times._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._


=With Frederick the Great=: A Tale of the Seven Years’ War. By G. A.
HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by WAL PAGET, and Maps. 6_s._

 “The story is one of Mr. Henty’s best, and so cleverly is history
 interwoven with fiction that the boy who reads it will know as much
 about the _Seven Years’ War_ as many an adult student of Carlyle’s
 masterpiece.”--_Standard._

=With Moore at Corunna=: A Tale of the Peninsular War. By G. A. HENTY.
With 12 page Illustrations by WAL PAGET. 6_s._

 “A very spirited story, well worthy to be ranked with the best of
 Mr. Henty’s work. Terence O’Connor, up to the time of the opening of
 the tale, has done little but get into mischief, but as soon as he
 feels the responsibility of being one of Mr. Henty’s heroes, combines
 discretion with courage, not forgetting, however, to spice the mixture
 with a little fun.”--_Spectator._

HENTY. With 12 Illustrations by W. H. MARGETSON, and a Map. 6_s._

 fiction together with so skilful a hand that the reader cannot help
 acquiring a just and clear view of that fierce and terrible struggle
 which gave to us our Indian Empire.”--_Athenæum._

=A Knight of the White Cross=: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes. By G. A.
HENTY. With 12 full-page Illustrations by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

 sufficiently popular to be sure of a welcome anywhere.... In stirring
 interest, this is quite up to the level of Mr. Henty’s former
 historical tales.”--_Saturday Review._

=When London Burned=: A Story of Restoration Times and the Great Fire.
By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by J. FINNEMORE. 6_s._

 “No boy needs to have any story of Henty’s recommended to him, and
 parents who do not know and buy him for their boys should be ashamed
 of themselves. Those to whom he is yet unknown could not make a better
 beginning than with _When London Burned_.”--_British Weekly._

 “Schoolboys owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Henty.”--_The Record._

=At Agincourt=: A Tale of the White Hoods of Paris. By G. A. HENTY.

 is most effectively combined with a most excellent plot.”--_Saturday
 Review._

=With Wolf in Canada=: or, The Winning of a Continent. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 “A model of what a boys’ story-book should be. Mr. Henty has a great
 power of infusing into the dead facts of history new life, and as no
 pains are spared by him to ensure accuracy in historic details, his
 books supply useful aids to study as well as amusement.”--_School
 Guardian._

=Bonnie Prince Charlie=: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden. By G. A.
HENTY. Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 “As good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness
 of treatment and variety of incident, Mr. Henty has here surpassed
 himself.”--_Spectator._

=For the Temple=: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem. By G. A. HENTY. With
10 page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON, and a Coloured Map. 6_s._

 “Mr. Henty’s graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
 resistance to Roman sway adds another leaf to his record of the
 famous wars of the world. The book is one of Mr. Henty’s cleverest
 efforts.”--_Graphic._

 among the hostile redskins in that very Huron country which has been
 endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye and Chingachgook.”--_The
 Times._

HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I. 6_s._

 bears us along as on a stream whose current varies in direction, but
 never loses its force.”--_Saturday Review._

=Redskin and Cow-boy=: A Tale of the Western Plains. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by ALFRED PEARSE. 6_s._

 “It has a good plot; it abounds in action; the scenes are equally
 spirited and realistic. The pictures of life on a cattle ranche are
 most graphically painted, as are the manners of the reckless but
 jovial cow-boys.”--_Times._

=The Lion of the North=: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus. By G. A. HENTY.
With 12 page Pictures by J. SCHÖNBERG. 6_s._

 of the Scotch Brigade in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus.”--_Athenæum._

 usual, the whole result leaves nothing to be desired.”--_Journal of
 Education._

=The Dash for Khartoum=: A Tale of the Nile Expedition. By G. A. HENTY.
With 10 page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG and J. NASH, and 4 Plans.
6_s._

 incidents which fall to be recorded after the dash for Khartoum has
 been made and failed are quite as interesting as those which precede
 it.”--_Academy._

=With Lee in Virginia=: A Story of the American Civil War. By G. A.
HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE, and 6 Maps. 6_s._

 “The story is a capital one and full of variety. Young Wingfield, who
 is conscientious, spirited, and ‘hard as nails’, would have been a man
 after the very heart of Stonewall Jackson.”--_Times._

=By Right of Conquest=: or, With Cortez in Mexico. By G. A. HENTY. With
10 page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY. 6_s._

 perfectly successful historical tale that Mr. Henty has yet
 published.”--_Academy._

in South American Waters. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by
W. H. MARGETSON. 6_s._

 his many valiant fights in the cause of liberty deserve to be better
 known than they are.”--_St. James’s Gazette._

 people.”--_Spectator._

=Beric the Briton=: A Story of the Roman Invasion. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by W. PARKINSON. 6_s._

=By Pike and Dyke=: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic. By G. A.
HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4 Maps. 6_s._

 best.”--_Academy._

=Wulf the Saxon=: A Story of the Norman Conquest. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

 history than he will from many a tedious tome.”--_The Spectator._

 for boys.”--_St. James’s Gazette._

 the high standard of interest which we have learnt to expect from
 him.”--_Spectator._

 “The story of Wat Tyler’s ever-famous insurrection is set forth with a
 degree of cunning and an eye for effect that may always be looked for
 in the work that comes from this practised hand. Mr. Henty deals with
 troublesome times and with characters that have left their mark on the
 pages of history. He is fresh, virile, and never dull, and this volume
 must needs add to his reputation.”--_Daily Telegraph._

 cover to cover’.”--_Observer._

 we are quite sure.”--_Daily Telegraph._

=Condemned as a Nihilist=: A Story of Escape from Siberia. By G. A.
HENTY. Illustrated by WALTER PAGET. 5_s._

 “The best of this year’s Henty. His narrative is more interesting than
 many of the tales with which the public is familiar, of escape from
 Siberia. Despite their superior claim to authenticity these tales are
 without doubt no less fictitious than Mr. Henty’s, and he beats them
 hollow in the matter of sensations.”--_National Observer._

=Orange and Green=: A Tale of the Boyne and Limerick. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

HENTY. Illustrated by J. SCHÖNBERG. 5_s._

 gentleman.”--_Christian Leader._

=The Dragon and the Raven=: or, The Days of King Alfred. By G. A.
HENTY. With 8 page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I. 5_s._

 “A story that may justly be styled remarkable. Boys, in reading it,
 will be surprised to find how Alfred persevered, through years of
 bloodshed and times of peace, to rescue his people from the thraldom
 of the Danes. We hope the book will soon be widely known in all our
 schools.”--_Schoolmaster._

=A Final Reckoning=: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by W. B. WOLLEN. 5_s._

 “All boys will read this story with eager and unflagging interest.
 The episodes are in Mr. Henty’s very best vein--graphic, exciting,
 realistic; and, as in all Mr. Henty’s books, the tendency is
 to the formation of an honourable, manly, and even heroic
 character.”--_Birmingham Post._

=The Young Colonists=: A Tale of the Zulu and Boer Wars. By G. A.
HENTY. With 6 Illustrations by SIMON H. VEDDER. 3_s._ 6_d._

 period.”--_Standard._

 English.”--_Expository Times._

=Lords of the World=: A Tale of the Fall of Carthage and Corinth. By A.
J. CHURCH. With 12 page Illustrations by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

 “Mr. Church’s mastery of his subject and his literary skill are
 sufficiently complete to carry his adult readers with him. Some of
 the scenes are highly picturesque, and there is many an exciting
 adventure that sustains the reader’s curiosity in the fortunes of the
 hero, Cleanor. As a boys’ book, _Lords of the World_ deserves a hearty
 welcome.”--_Spectator._

 [Illustration: _Reduced Illustration from “Lords of the World”._]

=Two Thousand Years Ago=: or, The Adventures of a Roman Boy. By
Professor A. J. CHURCH. With 12 page Illustrations by ADRIEN MARIE.

 as well as useful, and there is a wonderful freshness in the Roman
 scenes and characters.”--_The Times._




 BY HERBERT HAYENS.


=Paris at Bay=: A Story of the Siege and the Commune. By HERBERT
HAYENS. With 8 page Illustrations by STANLEY L. WOOD. 5_s._

 “The story culminates in the terrible struggle between the
 Versaillists and the men who follow the red flag. Mr. Hayens holds the
 balance with commendable impartiality. He loves to describe a good
 soldier on whichever side he may fight. Altogether _Paris at Bay_ is
 of more than average merit.”--_Spectator._

 department.”--_Daily News._

 _In crown 8vo, cloth elegant._

FENN. Illustrated by FRANK DADD. 6_s._

 It is full of incident and mystery, and the mystery is kept up to the
 last moment. It is rich in effective local colouring; and it has a
 historical interest.”--_Times._

=Devon Boys=: A Tale of the North Shore. By G. MANVILLE FENN. With 12
page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 “An admirable story, as remarkable for the individuality of its
 young heroes as for the excellent descriptions of coast scenery and
 life in North Devon. It is one of the best books we have seen this
 season.”--_Athenæum._

=The Golden Magnet=: A Tale of the Land of the Incas. By G. MANVILLE
FENN. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 “There could be no more welcome present for a boy. There is not a dull
 page in the book, and many will be read with breathless interest. ‘The
 Golden Magnet’ is, of course, the same one that attracted Raleigh and
 the heroes of _Westward Ho!_”--_Journal of Education._

=In the King’s Name=: or, The Cruise of the _Kestrel_. By G. MANVILLE
FENN. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 the youngsters have such fascinating literature provided for their
 evenings’ amusement.”--_Spectator._

=Quicksilver=: or, A Boy with no Skid to his Wheel. By GEORGE MANVILLE
FENN. With 6 page Illustrations by FRANK DADD. 3_s._ 6_d._

 It is an ideal book for a boy’s library.”--_Practical Teacher._

 Boy_.”--_Pictorial World._

Illustrations. 3_s._ 6_d._

 should be.”--_Manchester Guardian._

=The Princess and Curdie.= By GEORGE MAC DONALD. With 8 page
Illustrations. 3_s._ 6_d._

Adventure. By HARRY COLLINGWOOD. With 6 page Illustrations by GORDON
BROWNE. 3_s._ 6_d._

 with incredible speed she flies through the air, skims over the
 surface of the water, and darts along the ocean bed. We strongly
 recommend our schoolboy friends to possess themselves of her
 log.”--_Athenæum._

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
